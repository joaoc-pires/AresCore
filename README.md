# AresCore
Ares Core is a façade for multiple libraries that allow to retrieve RSS, ATOM, and JSON feeds.
It’s an opinionated library that uses only the most used fields of all the feeds, ignoring others. It tries to provide an object (item/entry) with a title, published date, author, publication, banner image, and content.

The goal of this library is to make a stable foundation to retrieve syndicated feeds from websites.
